# Privacy policy

### 1. Introduction

At [Activist.org](http://activist.org), we are dedicated to providing a secure and anonymous platform for activists worldwide. Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations to exercise their rights to free speech and assembly without fear of surveillance or reprisal. Privacy is not just a feature for us; it is the cornerstone of our platform.

[Activist.org](http://activist.org) is currently operated by CC\&P, registered temporarily at the address of Impact Hub Berlin. We are in the process of establishing a formal association in Switzerland, a country renowned for its strong constitutional protections of privacy and free speech.

We exclusively partner with organizations that have a proven track record of defending free speech and anonymity. We believe that safeguarding your privacy is paramount in protecting you from adversaries, whether they are oppressive governments, private sector actors, or other groups seeking to infringe upon your rights.

### 2. Data Controller

The legal entity responsible for data processing at [Activist.org](http://activist.org) is CC\&P (full legal name pending upon formal registration in Switzerland). For any inquiries related to data protection, please contact:

* **Email:** [security@activist.org](mailto:security@activist.org)

Our dedicated data protection team handles all queries related to your personal data. We encourage users to reach out with any concerns or questions they may have.

### 3. Personal Data Collected

We are committed to collecting the minimal amount of personal data necessary:

* **Account Creation:** You can create an account without providing any personal information, such as an email address.
* **User Advice:** We strongly advise users to utilize VPN services to enhance their privacy and security while using our platform.
* **User Content:** We caution users against sharing personal data like names, addresses, or any identifying information within the platform.

**Data Collected Through Forms:**

* **Formbricks (Self-Hosted):** When you participate in user testing or request access to the platform, we may collect information through forms powered by Formbricks, which we host ourselves. The data collected may include contact information (e.g., email address) and any additional information you choose to provide. This data is used solely for the purposes specified at the time of collection and is stored securely on our servers.

**Interaction via Third-Party Platforms:**

* **Social Media (Instagram and GitHub):** We maintain a presence on social media platforms like Instagram and GitHub. If you interact with us through these platforms—such as following our accounts, commenting on posts, or contributing to our GitHub repositories—your interactions are subject to the privacy policies of the respective platforms. We do not collect or store personal data from these interactions unless explicitly provided by you.

**Communication Platforms:**

* **Element on** [**Matrix.org**](http://matrix.org)**:** Currently, we use Element on the [Matrix.org](http://matrix.org) instance to facilitate communication. While we do not control [Matrix.org](http://matrix.org)'s servers, we are committed to ensuring the privacy of our communications. We aim to migrate to a self-hosted version of Element, hosted in Switzerland, to enhance security and privacy. Please be aware that any data transmitted through [Matrix.org](http://matrix.org) is subject to their privacy policies until we complete this migration.

**Automatic Data Collection:**

* We use **Plausible Analytics** for website traffic analysis. Plausible is a privacy-focused tool that does not use cookies or collect personal data. It provides us with aggregated insights without compromising individual user privacy.

We do not collect any sensitive personal data unless explicitly provided by you, and we ensure all data collection complies with legal standards.
