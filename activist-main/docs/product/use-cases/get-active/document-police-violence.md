# Document police violence

Protests are moments of collective power and hope, but they can also become spaces of repression and violence, particularly by law enforcement. Around the world, activists face similar challenges: ensuring safety while holding power accountable. Documenting police actions at protests is a critical tool for justice and transparency, exposing abuses of power, and amplifying the voices of those most affected.

The importance of documenting police actions goes beyond individual incidents. Evidence of misconduct can lead to legal accountability, shape public opinion, and pressure institutions to reform. Grassroots documentation strengthens our collective resilience by telling the truth when those in power attempt to suppress it.

Laws and risks, however, vary widely across regions. While this guide draws from the authors’ familiarity with **Germany** and **France**, its principles can be applied globally. We encourage you to adapt this information to your local context, and if you need help, reach out to activist.org's **legal group**. Whether you’re an expert who can assist others or an activist seeking guidance, we’re here to connect you with the right resources.

Let’s begin by exploring the legal landscape, which shapes how you can safely and effectively document police violence.

***

## Step 1: **Understand the Legal Landscape**

Before taking any action, it’s vital to understand the laws in your country regarding the recording of police officers. Knowing your rights—and the risks—can help you document more confidently while protecting yourself and your community.

### **Germany**

In Germany, recording police officers in public is **generally permitted** under the right to freedom of expression, especially if the footage serves the public interest, such as exposing misconduct. However, there are key considerations:

* **Privacy Concerns**: Sharing footage that clearly identifies individuals—police officers or bystanders—can lead to legal challenges under privacy laws. Blurring faces is a critical step before distributing materials widely.
* **Seizure Risks**: Police may attempt to confiscate devices or footage under certain conditions, such as claiming it’s evidence of a crime. Understanding when and how they can legally do so is essential.

### **France**

France presents additional challenges due to restrictive legislation:

* The **Global Security Law** criminalizes the publication of images of police officers with the intent to harm, creating legal risks even for legitimate documentation.
* Activists often mitigate this by ensuring footage is anonymized and shared through trusted networks, prioritizing secure tools and platforms.

### **Other Regions**

Activists in other countries face a wide variety of legal situations:

* Some nations criminalize filming police entirely, while others actively encourage citizen oversight.
* Laws may differ between local and national jurisdictions, so researching protest-specific guidelines is crucial.

**How Activist.org Can Help**

Activist.org provides a dedicated **legal group** where activists can:

* **Get Help**: If you’re uncertain about the legal risks in your area, reach out for support. Our team can help connect you with local legal resources and pro bono lawyers.
* **Offer Expertise**: If you’re a legal professional or have expertise in this area, join us to help empower others. Your knowledge can make a difference in how activists navigate these challenges.

Understanding the legal landscape is the first step toward documenting police actions effectively and safely. Once you’re familiar with your rights and responsibilities, you can focus on preparation and collaboration for on-the-ground documentation.

## Step 2: **Prepare for Documentation Using Activist.org**

Activist.org provides tools and workflows that can support documentation efforts during protests. Here’s how you can use the platform to plan, organize, and execute safe and effective documentation:

***

### **1. Invite Support Through the Event Onboarding Flow**

During event registration, **ask participants if they’d like to assist with documentation**:

* Include a checkbox or question in the onboarding form: _"Would you like to support documenting this event for transparency and safety?"_
* Create a dedicated follow-up process to provide volunteers with clear instructions and assign roles like filming, observing, or backup coordination.

By integrating this step into the onboarding process, you ensure that documentation responsibilities are distributed and managed proactively.

***

### **2. Create a Documentation Guide for the Event**

Use collaborative tools like **pads** (e.g., Etherpad or CryptPad) to create a **step-by-step guide** for participants involved in documentation:

* Provide guidance on what to film (e.g., incidents of police violence, badge numbers, timestamps).
* Include safety tips, such as maintaining distance, staying aware of surroundings, and avoiding confrontation.
* Link to tools for blurring faces and removing metadata.

Share this pad with volunteers before the event, so everyone is prepared and aligned.

***

### **3. Use the Event Page’s Resources Section**

The **Resources Section** on the event page can be an essential hub for sharing preparation materials:

* Upload guides or link to external resources like the [Go Film the Police Guide](https://www.gofilmthepolice.de/go-film-the-police-guide-german-context/).
* Include tutorials for recommended tools, such as Signal, ObscuraCam, or metadata removal apps.
* Provide links to activist.org’s legal group for volunteers who may need legal advice.

This ensures that all participants, not just dedicated documentation volunteers, have access to vital resources.

***

### **4. Use the "Organizers Note" for Transparency**

The **Organizers Note** section on event pages can help prepare participants for potential risks and highlight your documentation readiness:

* Example message:\
  &#xNAN;_“Please note that there may be police repression during this event. We are coming prepared to document any incidents to ensure accountability. If you’d like to support this effort, see the resources linked below or reach out to organizers on-site.”_
* This note sets expectations while encouraging solidarity and awareness among attendees.

***

By leveraging these features, activist.org can support grassroots documentation efforts, ensuring that participants are informed, organized, and equipped to document protests safely and effectively.

## Step 3: **Safely Document Incidents During the Event**

Once you’re on the ground, documenting police violence or other incidents requires caution, preparation, and adaptability. Drawing from resources like the [Go Film the Police Guide](https://www.gofilmthepolice.de/go-film-the-police-guide-german-context/), this section provides a generalized approach to safely and effectively documenting incidents while minimizing risks to yourself and others.

***

### **1. Stay Safe and Situationally Aware**

Safety should always come first. While filming can be powerful, it’s not worth endangering yourself or others.

* **Maintain Distance**: Position yourself at a safe distance from confrontations to reduce the risk of being targeted or caught in the escalation.
* **Avoid Obstruction**: Ensure you are not interfering with police actions, as this could lead to accusations of obstruction or provocation.
* **Know Escape Routes**: Stay aware of your surroundings, and always have an exit strategy in case the situation deteriorates.

***

### **2. Capture Critical Information**

Effective documentation is about more than just pressing record. Focus on details that can provide context and evidence.

* **Badge Numbers and Identifiers**: Zoom in on badges, helmets, or vehicle license plates. These details are essential for accountability.
* **Chronological Details**: Record the flow of events, including any verbal commands, arrests, or use of force.
* **Environmental Context**: Capture signs, landmarks, or surroundings that establish the location and timeline of the event.
* **Witness Accounts**: Briefly document the experiences or statements of bystanders, if safe to do so.

***

### **3. Avoid Compromising Privacy or Security**

Respect for privacy and security is critical, especially when documenting marginalized communities or sensitive incidents.

* **Avoid Filming Protesters’ Faces**: Unless it is essential to the context, focus on actions rather than individuals. This protects fellow protesters from potential retaliation.
* **Use Blurring Tools**: For unavoidable footage of individuals, ensure you blur faces and identifying features before sharing.
* **Strip Metadata**: Before uploading photos or videos, use tools like ExifTool to remove location data and timestamps.

***

### **4. Securely Backup Your Footage**

Losing footage can be devastating, especially if it contains evidence of misconduct. Take steps to secure your recordings immediately.

* **Use Cloud Storage**: As soon as possible, upload your footage to a secure, encrypted cloud service. Tools like Nextcloud or Tresorit are reliable options.
* **Lock Your Device**: Ensure your phone or camera is password-protected and encrypted to prevent unauthorized access in case it’s confiscated.
* **Distribute Copies**: Share backups with trusted team members via encrypted communication channels like Signal.

***

### **5. Stay Calm if Confronted**

If police attempt to confiscate your device or question your actions:

* **Know Your Rights**: Stay informed about the legal protections available to you. For example, in Germany, police generally need a warrant to access your phone or demand deletion of footage.
* **De-escalate**: Remain calm and polite, and avoid provoking officers. Your safety is more important than holding your ground.
* **Call for Support**: If necessary, contact activist.org’s legal group for advice or connect with legal observers on-site.

## Step 5: **Collaborate for Impact**

Documenting police violence is only the first step. For your footage to drive meaningful change, it needs to be integrated into broader efforts for justice, advocacy, and systemic reform. This requires thoughtful collaboration with trusted individuals, organizations, and networks. Here's how to ensure your documentation has the greatest impact while protecting the safety of everyone involved.

***

### **1. Work with Advocacy and Accountability Groups**

Grassroots and legal organizations are often best equipped to leverage documentation for systemic change. Reach out to trusted groups who can use your footage for advocacy, legal cases, or public awareness.

* **Local Organizations**: Partner with community groups familiar with the local legal and political context, such as **Go Film the Police** in Germany or similar advocacy networks in your region.
* **National and International NGOs**: Collaborate with organizations like **Amnesty International**, **Human Rights Watch**, or **Reporters Without Borders**, who have experience using evidence to influence policy and public opinion.
* **Legal Teams**: If your footage could support victims in court, share it with legal professionals who can incorporate it into their cases.

***

### **2. Amplify Through Trusted Media Outlets**

Public awareness is a critical tool for accountability. Sharing your evidence with reputable journalists or media organizations can help your story reach a broader audience.

* **Investigative Journalists**: Partner with journalists experienced in covering police violence or social justice issues. They can ensure your footage is contextualized and ethically presented.
* **Activist Media Platforms**: Submit your documentation to platforms that focus on social justice or human rights reporting, ensuring it aligns with the movement’s goals.

Together, we can challenge injustice and build a stronger, more accountable society.

## Step 6: **Know Your Rights and Respond to Challenges**

Sharing footage of police violence or misconduct can lead to pushback from authorities, legal threats, or even attempts to suppress your evidence. Knowing your rights and preparing for these challenges ensures that your documentation contributes to justice without exposing you or others to unnecessary risks.

This step provides strategies to navigate legal and social obstacles while maintaining the integrity of your documentation.

***

### **1. Understand Your Rights**

Before sharing or publishing your footage, familiarize yourself with the laws in your region regarding recording and distributing police actions.

* **Germany**: Filming police in public is generally allowed for purposes like public interest or accountability, but privacy laws may apply if individuals are identifiable. Authorities cannot demand deletion of footage but may seize devices under specific circumstances.
* **France**: The **Global Security Law** prohibits malicious use of police images but does not outlaw documentation entirely. Anonymizing footage is essential to minimize legal risks.
* **Other Regions**: Legal protections and risks vary widely. Research your local laws or consult with activist.org’s **legal group** for tailored advice.

***

### **2. Be Prepared for Device Seizures**

Authorities may attempt to confiscate devices or delete footage, even if such actions are not legally justified.

* **Lock and Encrypt Your Devices**: Always secure your phone or camera with strong passwords and enable encryption.
* **Backup Footage Immediately**: Use cloud storage or encrypted USB drives to save footage as soon as possible. Tools like **Nextcloud** or **Tresorit** offer secure, end-to-end encrypted storage.
* **Minimize Risky Storage**: Avoid keeping sensitive footage on your device for extended periods, especially when crossing borders or passing through checkpoints.

***

### **3. Respond to Legal Challenges**

If authorities or individuals contest your right to record or share footage:

* **Remain Calm and Polite**: De-escalate interactions with law enforcement by being respectful while standing firm on your rights.
* **Request Legal Justification**: Ask officers to cite the specific laws that allow them to confiscate or demand deletion of your footage.
* **Seek Legal Support**: Contact activist.org’s **legal group** or local organizations like **Amnesty International** for immediate assistance.

***

### **4. Protect Yourself from Online Harassment**

Sharing footage publicly, especially online, can attract harassment or disinformation campaigns. Protect yourself by:

* **Using Pseudonyms**: Avoid sharing sensitive footage under your real name. Use an organizational account or alias instead.
* **Limiting Personal Exposure**: If possible, let advocacy groups or trusted media outlets share the footage on your behalf.
* **Monitoring Responses**: Be prepared to counter misinformation by documenting the authenticity of your footage and having trusted allies support you online.

***

### **5. Build Legal and Community Solidarity**

If you face legal or social challenges, lean on your networks for support:

* **Legal Networks**: Activist.org’s legal group can connect you with pro bono lawyers or organizations that specialize in defending activists.
* **Community Campaigns**: Rally support through solidarity campaigns or public petitions if you’re targeted for sharing your footage.
* **Prepare Witness Statements**: Encourage others present at the event to document their perspectives, creating a collective defense if needed.

***
